Iterator - How to traversal of data structures happens and who makes it happen.

Motivation:
            - Iteration (traversal is a core functionality of various data structures
            - An iterator is a class that facilitates the traversal
                * keeps a reference to the current element
                * knows how to move to a different element
            - Java has Iterator<T> and Iterable<T>
                * Iterator<T> specifies the iterator API (can be used to travers a particular thing)
                * A class needs to be Iterable in order to support forEach loop

Iterator - An object that facilitates the traversal of data structure


___

summary:
        - an iterator specified how you can traverse some data structure
        - Iterator cannot be recursive
        - Iterator implements Iterator<T>, iterable object implements Iterable<T>
