Bridge - Connecting components together through abstractions

Motivation:
- prevents a 'Cartesian Product' complexity explosion
        For example: Lets take this scenario
            + Base class ThreadScheduler
            + Can be preemptive or cooperative
            + Can run on Windows or Unix
            + End up with a 2x2 scenario: WindowsPTS, UnixPTS, WindowsCTS, UnixCTS classes
- Bridge pattern avoids the entity explosion.

Bridge = A mechanism that decouples an interface (hierarchy) from implementation (hierarchy)
        In this case you can have some inheritance/some aggregation


Summary:
        - Decouple abstraction from implementation
        - Both can exist as hierarchies
        - A stronger form of encapsulation
