Adapter - Getting the interface you want from the interface you have

Adapter: A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y
         what does this mean is that you are getting interface X from some system, but some other system require
         interface Y. So what you have to do is to connect one to another and write extra code to make it possible

The concept of an adapter is similar to the plugin adapter which used to connect to different plugin.
        Some plugin require different specification based on the given requirements, you can consider the interface as a
        requirement to simplify the concept.

Summary:
- Implementing an Adapter is easy
- Determine the API you have and the API you need
- Create a component which aggregates (has a reference to what ever being adapted or you can even instantiated) the adaptee
- Intermediate representations can pile up: using caching and other optimizations
