Prototype - When it's easier to copy an existing object to fully initialize a new one.
- A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of ot

Motivation:
- Complicated objects (e.g. car) aren't design from scratch
    They reiterate existing design making them better
- An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a Prototype
    You have already design/define something very complicated type, and then you want to make variation on it.
- In order to make variation, we make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it
    Require 'deep copy' support. It's a situation where you're copying not just the object but copying all your object reference
    by making new objects which replicate the state those reference
- We make the cloning convenient (e.g. via a Factory)
